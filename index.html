    <h3 id="h3">Here's a time line of Dr. Borlaug's life:</h3>

    <ul>

        <li id="l1"><b>1914</b> - Born in Cresco, Iowa</li><br>

        <li id="l2"><b>1933</b> - Leaves his family's farm to attend the University of Minnesota, thanks <br>
               to a Depression era program known as the "National Youth Administration"</li><br>

        <li id="l3" ><b>1935</b> - Has to stop school and save up more money. Works in the Civilian <br>
               Conservation Corps, helping starving Americans. "I saw how food changed <br>
               them", he said. "All of this left scars on me."</li><br>

        <li id="l4"><b>1937</b> - Finishes university and takes a job in the US Forestry Service</li><br>

        <li id="l5"><b>1938</b> - Marries wife of 69 years Margret Gibson. Gets laid off due to budget <br>
               cuts. Inspired by Elvin Charles Stakman, he returns to school study under <br>
               Stakman, who teaches him about breeding pest-resistent plants.</li><br>

        <li id="l6"><b>1941</b> - Tries to enroll in the military after the Pearl Harbor attack, but is <br>
               rejected. Instead, the military asked his lab to work on waterproof glue, DDT <br>
               to control malaria, disinfectants, and other applied science.</li><br>

        <li id="l7"><b>1942</b> - Receives a Ph.D. in Genetics and Plant Pathology</li><br>

        <li id="l8"><b>1944</b> - Rejects a 100% salary increase from Dupont, leaves behind his <br>
               pregnant wife, and flies to Mexico to head a new plant pathology program. <br>
               Over the next 16 years, his team breeds 6,000 different strains of disease <br>
               resistent wheat - including different varieties for each major climate on Earth.</li><br>

        <li id="l9"><b>1945</b> - Discovers a way to grown wheat twice each season, doubling wheat <br>
               yields</li><br>

        <li id="l10"><b>1953</b> - crosses a short, sturdy dwarf breed of wheat with a high-yeidling <br> 
               American breed, creating a strain that responds well to fertilizer. It goes on to <br>
               provide 95% of Mexico's wheat.</li><br>

        <li id="l11"><b>1962</b> - Visits Delhi and brings his high-yielding strains of wheat to the Indian <br>
               subcontinent in time to help mitigate mass starvation due to a rapidly <br>
               expanding population</li><br>

        <li id="l12"><b>1970</b> - receives the Nobel Peace Prize</li><br>

        <li id="l13"><b>1983</b> - helps seven African countries dramatically increase their maize and <br>
               sorghum yields</li><br>

        <li id="l14"><b>1984</b> - becomes a distinguished professor at Texas A&M University</li><br>

        <li id="l15"><b>2005</b> - states "we will have to double the world food supply by 2050." Argues <br>
               that genetically modified crops are the only way we can meet the demand, as <br>
               we run out of arable land. Says that GM crops are not inherently dangerous <br>
               because "we've been genetically modifying plants and animals for a long <br>
               time. Long before we called it science, people were selecting the best breeds."</li><br>

        <li id="l16"><b>2009</b> - dies at the age of 95.</li><br>



</ul>




<p id="p5"><i>"Borlaug's life and achievement are testimony to the far-reaching contribution <br>
       that one man's towering intellect, persistence and scientific vision can make to <br>
       human peace and progress.</i></p>
